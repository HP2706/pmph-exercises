---                                               ---
---  In the sparse, nested-parallel format it is  ---
---  represented as a list of lists named mat     ---
---  [ [(0,2.0),  (1,-1.0)],                      ---
---    [(0,-1.0), (1, 2.0), (2,-1.0)],            ---
---    [(1,-1.0), (2, 2.0), (3,-1.0)],            ---
---    [(2,-1.0), (3, 2.0)],                      ---
---    [(3,3.0)]                                  ---
---  ]                                            ---
---                                               ---
--- The nested-parallel code is something like:   ---
--- map (\ row ->                                 ---
---         let prods =                           ---
---               map (\(i,x) -> x*vct[i]) row    ---
---         in  reduce (+) 0 prods                ---
---     ) mat                                     ---
---                                               ---
--- mat is the flattened data of the matrix above,---
---  while shp holds the sizes of each row, i.e., ---
---                                               ---
--- mat_val =
---       [ (0,2.0),(1,-1.0),(0,-1.0),(1, 2.0),   ---
---         (2,-1.0),(1,-1.0),(2, 2.0),(3,-1.0),  ---
---         (2,-1.0),(3, 2.0),(3,3.0)             ---
---       ]                                       ---
--- mat_shp = [2,3,3,2,1]                         ---
---
--- The vector is dense and matches the number of ---
---   columns of the matrix                       ---
---   e.g., x = [2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3.0] (transposed) ---
---                                               ---
--- YOUR TASK is to implement the function below  ---
--- such that it consists of only flat-parallel   ---
--- operations and is semantically equivalent to  ---
--- the nested parallel program described above   ---
--- See also Section 3.2.4 ``Sparse-Matrix Vector ---
--- Multiplication'' in lecture notes, page 40-41.---
--- You may use in your implementation the        ---
--- `sgmSumF32` function provided above.          ---
--- You may also take a look at the sequential    ---
--- implementation in file spMVmult-seq.fut.      ---
--- If the futhark-opencl compiler complains about---
---  unsafe code try wrapping the offending       ---
---  expression with keyword `unsafe`.            ---
---                                               ---
--- Necessary steps for the flat-parallel implem: ---
--- 1. you need to compute the flag array from shp---
---    if you cannot figure it out, take a look   ---
---    at `mkFlagArray` in lecture notes,         ---
---    section 4, page 48                         ---
--- 2. you need to multiply all elements of the   ---
---    matrix with their corresponding vector     ---
---    element                                    ---
--- 3. you need to sum up the products above      ---
---    across each row of the matrix. This can    ---
---    be achieved with a segmented scan and then ---
---    with a map that extracts the last element  ---
---    of the segment.
